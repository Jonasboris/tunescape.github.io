			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<h5><p>Growing up in a talented musical family meant that Nishan was always surrounded by different forms of music.

Born in Boston , it was here that he developed his musical tastes and interests, and it wasnt long after picking up a guitar that he was experimenting with the traditional Indian drum known as the Bodhran, followed by the Bouzouki and the Banjo, all of which have had a profound influence on the direction his musical journey has taken.

After realising that making music was his main goal, he began to showcase his talent in various venues across Boston , playing at numerous gigs and making sure that his name and music were being heard by as many people as possible.

The biggest of these was the switch from Boston to India , which has allowed him to develop as a person, and has in turn profoundly aided his musical development.

Other changes that have affected and influenced his song-writing over recent years have been his development of political writing, an area that he pays a lot of attention to and incorporates to a certain degree in his music, employing sound bites of news reports to add an extra dimension to some of his songs.</p></h5>
